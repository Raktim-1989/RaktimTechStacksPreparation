1. Angular is a typescript based web application framework for developing 
   web applications & mobile applications
2. Pre-requisites:
   i. Node.js -> an open source run time environment to run javascript / typescript code. It runs on google v8 enginee and execute the .js & .ts code outside of web browser. 
   ii. Download Visual Studio Code as editor

### Building Angular components for app development ###
1. Install the Angular CLI dependencies 
   npm install -g @angular/cli    -> give this command in admin mode from cmd prompt
2. Create Angular workspace 
   ng new <projectname>
   Following important modules will be generated automatically
   node_modules
   src
     app
       components   //auo generated
         component.css
         component.html
         component.ts
         component.spec.ts
       app-routing.module.ts  //important
       app.component.html
       app.module.ts //important  - all compoennets should be displayed
   angular.json
   karma.conf.js
   package.json
   tsconfig.json      
3. Start the server 
   ng serve --open
4. Components are building blocks in UI for developing angular apps
   i. it consists of HTML
   ii. a typescript class where we will write the logic of front end behavior
   iii. css 
   iv. testspec file for writing unit / integration test cases to test component
5. ng generate component <componentname>
6. Once we create components, the most importan file created is component.ts file where the following configurations are configured by default
@Component({
  selector: 'app-alert-details',
  templateUrl: './alert-details.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./alert-details.component.css']
})
//'selector' part is most important , here we are asking angualr to render this component into html file(browser side)
//now if we want to see the coresponding html in browser we will have to do following in app.component.html which is the main .html--
in app.component.html file -> <app-alert-details></app-alert-details>

### Interpolation in Angular ###
1. Interpolation is a process in angular which allows dynamic string values into your HTML templates. 
2. By default, interpolation uses {{}} as delimiters.
   title:string = "Raktim Sarkar"
   <h2>{{title}}</h2>
3. How we can use other file data in our existing component.ts file
   i. we have a products.ts (variable products) file where we kept our testdata 
   ii. now if we want to use those test data into our product-details.component.ts file we will do following --
    import { products } from 'src/data/products';
    import { ProductContract } from 'src/productContract';
    
    products : ProductContract[] = products;   //declaring local variable and assign the products variable data into local products variable
    //ProductContract is an interface
    ProductContract.ts file -> 
    export interface ProductContract =
    {
        name: string ,
        price: number,
        description: string
    }
   iii. in the product-details.html file render the following -
        <h2>{{products[0].name}}</h2> 
        <h2>{{products[0].price}}</h2> 
        <h2>{{products[0].description}}</h2> 
        
         <h2>{{products[1].name}}</h2> 
         <h2>{{products[1].price}}</h2> 
         <h2>{{products[1].description}}</h2> 
    we have a problem over this, if we have 100 products we have to mention here like this. we will use looping concept like ng-for !!!
